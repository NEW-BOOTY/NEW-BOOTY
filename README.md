/**
 * This code defines a blockchain system with enhanced features, including quantum-resistant cryptography, sharding, proof-of-stake (PoS), and smart contracts. Here's a breakdown of its components and capabilities:
 *
 * ### Components
 *
 * 1. **EnhancedCryptoCoin Class**
 *    - **Main Method**: Initializes the blockchain, creates wallets, and performs transactions using quantum-resistant cryptography (SPHINCS+).
 *
 * 2. **Blockchain Class**
 *    - **Chain**: List of blocks.
 *    - **Difficulty**: Mining difficulty.
 *    - **UTXOs**: Unspent transaction outputs.
 *    - **Shards**: Divides transactions into multiple shards for parallel processing.
 *    - **Methods**: Add genesis transaction, add block, validate chain, assign transactions to shards.
 *
 * 3. **Shard Class**
 *    - **Transactions**: List of transactions in the shard.
 *    - **Methods**: Add transaction, verify transactions.
 *
 * 4. **Block Class**
 *    - **Hash**: Current block hash.
 *    - **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block.
 *    - **Transactions**: List of transactions in the block.
 *    - **Methods**: Calculate hash, mine block, add transaction.
 *
 * 5. **Transaction Class**
 *    - **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier.
 *    - **Sender/Recipient**: Public keys of sender and recipient.
 *    - **Value**: Amount being transferred.
 *    - **Inputs/Outputs**: List of transaction inputs and outputs.
 *    - **Methods**: Calculate hash, generate signature, verify signature, process transaction.
 *
 * 6. **TransactionInput Class**
 *    - **TransactionOutputId**: ID of the referenced transaction output.
 *    - **UTXO**: Unspent transaction output.
 *
 * 7. **TransactionOutput Class**
 *    - **ID**: Unique identifier.
 *    - **Recipient**: Public key of the recipient.
 *    - **Value**: Amount being transferred.
 *    - **Methods**: Check if the output belongs to a specific public key.
 *
 * 8. **Wallet Class**
 *    - **Private/Public Key**: Key pair for the wallet.
 *    - **Methods**: Generate key pair, get balance, send funds.
 *
 * ### Capabilities
 *
 * - **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Uses SPHINCS+ for secure transactions.
 * - **Sharding**: Divides transactions into multiple shards for parallel processing.
 * - **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Implements PoS consensus mechanism.
 * - **Smart Contracts**: Supports smart contracts for automated transactions.
 * - **Transaction Verification**: Verifies signatures and ensures input/output values match.
 * - **Mining**: Mines blocks with a specified difficulty.
 * - **Wallet Management**: Creates wallets, generates key pairs, checks balances, and sends funds.
 *
 * This system provides a robust and secure blockchain implementation with advanced features for enhanced performance and security.
